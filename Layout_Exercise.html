        <div class="column">The G20 member countries will work towards facilitating access to low-cost finance for existing as well as new and emerging clean and sustainable energy technologies for supporting the energy transitions, as per the outcome document of the meeting held in Goa on Saturday.

            The outcome document on the Energy Transitions Ministers' meeting has stressed expediting the voluntary transfer on mutually agreed terms or co-development and adoption of clean, sustainable and low carbon emission energy technologies, which are often capital-intensive and necessitate low-cost financing from various sources.
            
            The meeting, chaired by Union Power Minister R K Singh, noted the report on “Low-cost Financing for the Energy Transition” prepared under the Indian Presidency and its estimation that the world needs an annual investment of over USD 4 trillion, with a high share of renewable energy in the primary energy mix.
